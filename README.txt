Hi,

Thanks for your interest in our book!

The code for chapters 5-7 is self-contained, each in it's own zip file. These use JSP backends - see Appendix C for setup details.

Chapters 2-4 and 12 use the QuickGallery code, which has a PHP back-end - see Appendix D for setup instructions. The title page references the various versions of the gallery by chapter.

Chapters 8-11 use the Scratchpad application, which can run either straight off the filesystem, or a web server of your choice (no server-side components to install)!

Best Regards,
